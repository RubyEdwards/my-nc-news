# Northcoders News API

Welcome to my first Northcoders project! I'm building a news API with the skills I've learned so far.

Please feel free to clone my project and run it locally, here are some instructions for you:

- Create an environment file (.env.\*) for each of your databases, and connect to the relevant database with PGDATABASE=

- Install express

- Install supertest as a developer dependency (if you want to write your own tests!)
  - Install jest-sorted if necessary for your testing

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)
